With Logistic Regression we trained our model on the training data and then tested it on test data. We checked the accuracy score for prediction model on training data and testing data. Before this we had to do under sampling as the distribution difference was too large due to which our accuracy would have faced bottlenecks.

A credit card fraud detection model is a machine learning or artificial intelligence system designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions made using credit or debit cards. Its primary objective is to protect both cardholders and financial institutions by flagging and blocking potentially fraudulent activities. Here's a general description of how such a model typically works:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Data Gathering: The first step in building a credit card fraud detection model is to collect historical transaction data. This data typically includes information such as transaction amount, transaction time, merchant information, and whether the transaction was fraudulent or legitimate.

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial to prepare the data for model training. This includes handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Building:

Supervised Learning: Credit card fraud detection is typically a supervised learning problem. Common algorithms used include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Since fraudulent transactions are relatively rare compared to legitimate ones, the data is often imbalanced. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation are used to balance the dataset.

In summary, a credit card fraud detection model is a sophisticated machine learning system that employs historical transaction data, feature engineering, supervised learning algorithms, and continuous monitoring to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false alarms and ensuring compliance with regulations. Its effectiveness relies on the quality of data, feature selection, and the chosen machine learning algorithm, among other factors.
